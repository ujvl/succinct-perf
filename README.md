# Succinct Performance Benchmark Tools

This is a performance testing framework for [Succinct](https://github.com/amplab/succinct).

## Succinct Version
This framework is applicable for Succinct 1.2+.

## Constructing the dataset

Before running any benchmark, the dataset to be benchmarked against needs to be 
prepared. To do this, simply construct the corresponding Succinct 
data-structures and persist them to disk as follows:

```java
// Example for constructing SuccinctBuffer and persisting it to disk

// Read all of the file contents into a byte array
Path path = Paths.get("path/to/file");
byte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(path);

// Construct the Succinct data-structures
SuccinctBuffer buffer = new SuccinctBuffer(data);

// Persist the data structures to disk
buffer.writeToFile("path/to/output");
```

**Note that the construction is an expensive operation, and may take several
minutes to hours if the dataset is several gigabytes in size.**

## Running the benchmark

Before running the benchmark, you need to assemble the tool as follows:

```
mvn clean package
```

To run the benchmark, use the `succinct-perf` script provided in the `bin/` directory.

It's usage is as follows:

```
usage: succinct-pref
  -b <arg>   The benchmark to run; the specification format is
			 <class-name>.<method-name>. If only class name is specified,
			 then all benchmarks for that class name will be run. To run
			 all benchmarks for all classes, specify "all"
  -d <arg>   Path to serialized Succinct data. (REQUIRED)
  -e <arg>   Length of extract queries
  -n <arg>   Number of threads for throughput bench (on
			 SuccinctFileBuffer[-TFS])
  -q <arg>   Path to query file that contains query strings (Required for
			 search/count benchmarks).
  -r <arg>   Path where the results will be stored 
  -s <arg>   Storage mode for SuccinctBuffer benchmarks. Can be MEMORY_ONLY
			 or MEMORY_MAPPED.
  -t <arg>   Tachyon master path (REQUIRED if file on TFS)
```
